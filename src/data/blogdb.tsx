                <div className='mb-4'>
                    <p>As a skincare professional, I often meet clients who are living with <span className='font-semibold italic'>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</span> — a condition that affects around one in ten people who menstruate, according to the NHS.</p>
                    <p>It’s much more than a hormonal disorder; PCOS can deeply influence the skin, confidence, and emotional wellbeing.</p>
                    <p>Many of my clients come to me frustrated after trying countless products and treatments without success. That’s why it’s so important to understand how PCOS affects the skin — and how the right, targeted professional treatments can help restore balance and confidence.</p>
                </div>
                <h1 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>How PCOS Can Affect the Skin</h1>
                <p>PCOS is caused by an imbalance in hormones, particularly higher levels of androgens (male hormones), which can disrupt normal ovulation and influence how the skin behaves.</p>
                <p>These hormonal changes often show up on the skin as:</p>
                <ul className='mx-8 my-4 list-disc'>
                    <li>Oily skin and persistent breakouts or acne</li>
                    <li>Increased hair growth on the face, chest, or other areas (known as hirsutism)</li>
                    <li>Pigmentation changes, such as darkening around the neck or underarms</li>
                    <li>Dry patches or skin tags, especially in areas of friction</li>
                    <li>Thinning hair or scalp sensitivity</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>My Approach to Treating PCOS-Affected Skin</h1>
                <div className='mb-4'> <p>Because PCOS affects each person differently, I take a customised and holistic approach to treatment. My goal is always to calm inflammation, restore balance, and support the skin’s healing from within.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the treatments I often recommend and perform in clinic:</p></div>
                <h1 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>LED Light Therapy</h1>
                <div className='flex items-center w-full justify-center mb-4'>

                </div>
                <p>One of the most effective ways to calm inflamed or acne-prone skin is through LED Light Therapy.</p>
                <ul className='mx-8 my-4 list-disc'>
                    <li><span className='font-semibold'>Blue light</span> targets acne-causing bacteria and helps prevent breakouts.</li>
                    <li><span className="font-semibold">Red and near-infrared light</span> soothe inflammation, boost circulation, and encourage healing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className='mb-4'>LED is a gentle, non-invasive treatment that can be used alone or combined with other facials to promote overall skin health — especially helpful for skin that’s easily aggravated or hormonally reactive.</p>
                <h1 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>Deep Cleansing & Extractions</h1>
                <div className='flex items-center w-full justify-center mb-4'>

                <div className='mb-4'>
                    <p>Many PCOS clients struggle with congested pores and persistent blackheads due to increased oil production.
                        A professional facial that includes <span className="font-semibold">gentle exfoliation and careful</span> extractions can make a huge difference.</p>
                    <p>By removing built-up sebum and debris safely (without damaging the skin), we allow the skin to breathe, reduce inflammation, and improve how future treatments and products perform.</p>
                </div>
                <h1 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>Other Helpful Treatments</h1>
                <div>
                    <p>In addition to LED, extractions, and chemical peels, some clients benefit from:</p>
                    <ul className='mx-8 my-4 list-disc'>
                        <li><span className='font-semibold'>Electrolysis</span>  – a permanent hair removal option for smaller or resistant areas.</li>
                        <li><span className="font-semibold">Targeted skincare</span> ncluding at-home products with <span className='font-semibold'>azelaic acid or salicylic acid </span>to maintain results and control breakouts between visits.</li>

                Permanent makeup (PMU) isn’t just about beauty — it’s about confidence, freedom, and saving precious time. Many of my clients tell me they wish they’d done it years earlier. So, how do you know if it’s the right choice for you? Here are five signs that PMU could be a life-changing step:
            </p>

            <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>1. You’re tired of the daily makeup routine</h2>
            <p className='mb-4'>
                If you spend 15–30 minutes every morning perfecting brows, eyeliner, or lips, imagine what you could do with that time instead. PMU gives you a polished look the moment you wake up.
            </p>

            <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>2. Your features have thinned or faded</h2>
            <p className='mb-4'>
                Brows overplucked in the 90s? Lips losing their natural color? PMU can gently restore definition and balance, enhancing your natural beauty.
            </p>

            <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>3. You want long-lasting confidence</h2>
            <p className='mb-4'>
                Whether it’s swimming, working out, or simply a busy lifestyle, PMU ensures you look fresh and confident without worrying about smudges or touch-ups.
            </p>

            <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>4. You’ve gone through changes</h2>
            <p className='mb-4'>
                From post-cancer hair loss to hormonal changes, many clients choose PMU to bring back what was lost — brows, lash line, or natural lip tone — and with it, their self-esteem.
            </p>

            <h2 className='font-semibold text-xl mb-4'>5. You’re ready for a confidence boost</h2>
            <p className='mb-4'>
                PMU isn’t about changing your face — it’s about enhancing what you already have. The results are natural, soft, and designed to make you feel like the best version of yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
                ✨ If any of these signs sound familiar, PMU could be the right step for you. Book your consultation today and let’s design a treatment that suits your features and lifestyle.

            <h1 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Discover Dermaplaning</h1>
            <p>
                If you’ve never tried dermaplaning, you’re seriously missing out on one of the most satisfying (and oddly addictive) steps in facial treatments. Imagine gently gliding a scalpel across the surface of your skin to sweep away dead skin cells and fine peach fuzz—leaving behind nothing but a ridiculously smooth, glowing complexion. Sounds intense? It’s actually one of the gentlest ways to exfoliate, and trust me, your makeup has never looked better after a dermaplane.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">So… Why Add Dermaplaning to Your Facial?</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s start with the glow-up. Dermaplaning removes the top layer of dull, dead skin, revealing fresh, healthy skin underneath. This not only gives you instant luminosity but also allows your skincare products to penetrate deeper and work harder—serums, we’re looking at you!
            </p>
            <p>
                And then there’s the peach fuzz. That soft vellus hair on your face traps dirt and oil, making your skin look a bit lackluster. By removing it, your skin becomes a smooth canvas—not just for skincare, but for flawless foundation application. Ever noticed how celebrities have that poreless, airbrushed look? Yep, this is one of their secrets.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">What's It Like?</h2>
            <p>
                It’s weirdly satisfying. Clients often describe it as the feeling of a tiny, gentle scratching sound—like a whisper of exfoliation that’s strangely relaxing. There’s no pain and no downtime, just smooth, silky skin that feels baby-soft.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">How Often Can You Dermaplane?</h2>
            <p>
                You’ll want to wait at least five weeks between treatments. This gives your skin time to regenerate and avoids over-exfoliation. Think of dermaplaning like your skin’s seasonal reset—not a weekly indulgence.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">A Treat That Rewards Loyalty</h2>
            <p>
                As an add-on to any facial, dermaplaning is available for £30—a small investment for a big glow-up. However, if you’re one of my loyal regulars and come in for your monthly facials, this step is free of charge. Yep, completely complimentary! It’s my way of thanking you for your loyalty and helping you keep that glow going without breaking the bank.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Is It Safe?</h2>
            <p>
                Like any exfoliating treatment, there is a risk of small scratches or nicks—but that’s where training and experience come in. When you're in my hands, safety and precision come first. Every dermaplaning session is performed with care, steady technique, and clean tools, so you can relax and enjoy the process.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Who Should Skip It?</h2>
            <p>
                While dermaplaning is safe for most skin types, it's not suitable for everyone. If you have active acne, open wounds, inflamed skin conditions (like eczema or psoriasis), or a history of keloid scarring, this treatment may not be the right fit. But don’t worry—I’ll always assess your skin first and guide you toward the best option for your unique needs.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">The Hairy Myth (Debunked)</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s clear this one up: Your hair will NOT grow back thicker or darker. That’s a common myth. Dermaplaning removes vellus hair, which is soft and fine. This type of hair doesn’t have the hormonal influence to grow back differently. It might feel a bit different as it grows in because it’s been cut bluntly—but it’s still the same baby-soft fuzz.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
                Dermaplaning is that extra step your skin will love you for. It’s safe, effective, oddly satisfying, and gives instant results that last. Once you try it, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Enter: Stretch Mark Camouflaging</h2>
            <p>
                But the real question is—does it actually work? Let’s break it down.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">🧬 What Is Stretch Mark Camouflage?</h2>
            <p>
                Stretch mark camouflage is a specialised form of skin tattooing that uses custom-blended pigments to match your natural skin tone and gently implant colour into the stretch marks. The goal isn’t to remove the stretch marks (no treatment truly can), but to visually blend them into your surrounding skin so they’re much less noticeable.
            </p>
            <p>
                This treatment is also known as paramedical tattooing or skin tone tattoo camouflage, and when done correctly, the results can be stunningly natural and long-lasting.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">So… Does It Really Work?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes—when done by a trained, experienced professional, stretch mark camouflage can dramatically reduce the appearance of stretch marks. Most clients see a noticeable improvement after just one session, with full results developing over several weeks as the skin heals and pigment settles.
            </p>
            <p>
                💬 Think of it like a permanent concealer specifically blended for your skin tone—except you don’t have to reapply it every day.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">💡 What Kind of Stretch Marks Can Be Camouflaged?</h2>
            <p>
                The best results are typically achieved on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Older stretch marks (white or light-toned)</li>
                <li>Flat, healed marks (not red or raised)</li>
                <li>Lighter skin types tend to respond more predictably, but all tones can be matched with expert pigment work</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If your stretch marks are very new (red or purple) or still healing, this treatment may need to wait until they mature.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">🔍 What It Doesn’t Do</h2>
            <p>Let’s keep it real:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It doesn’t remove stretch marks</li>
                <li>It doesn’t improve skin texture (if the skin is deeply indented or textured, we may pair it with microneedling to improve the surface first)</li>
                <li>It doesn’t tan—so if you get significantly darker in summer, there may be some contrast</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But even with those limitations, the visual improvement is often so significant that clients say they feel confident in bikinis, short sleeves, or even completely bare skin for the first time in years.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">What’s the Treatment Like?</h2>
            <p>
                The process involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Skin tone matching</li>
                <li>Pigment implantation using a machine or hand tool</li>
                <li>Healing period of around 4–6 weeks before full results show</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Most clients describe the sensation as similar to a tattoo or microneedling—completely tolerable, and no downtime apart from mild redness and aftercare.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">🔁 How Long Do Results Last?</h2>
            <p>
                Results are long-lasting, often several years or more, depending on your skin, sun exposure, and lifestyle. Occasional touch-ups may be needed over time, especially if your skin tone changes or fades slightly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">🚫 Who Is Not Suitable for This Treatment?</h2>
            <p>
                Stretch mark camouflage may not be suitable if you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have raised stretch marks</li>
                <li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
                <li>Have active skin conditions or are prone to keloid scarring</li>
                <li>Recently tanned or plan to tan heavily post-treatment</li>
            </ul>

                If you’ve been covering your stretch marks with makeup, clothing, or filters—and wish you didn’t have to—this treatment can be life-changing. It doesn’t remove them, but it makes them far less visible, and the confidence boost is very real.
            </p>
            <p>
                When done safely and skilfully, stretch mark camouflage really does work. The key is seeing a qualified professional who understands skin, pigment, and healing—and that's where I come in. 💖

                Plastic surgery is a powerful investment—not just in your appearance but in your confidence and how you feel every day. Whether it’s a tummy tuck, upper blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), facelift, or any other life-enhancing procedure, the goal is always to look and feel your absolute best. 💪💖
            </p>

            <p>
                But here’s the thing: sometimes, those incredible surgeries leave behind scars. And while scars are a natural part of the healing process, they don’t always tell the story you want. In fact, many people prefer their scars to be invisible or at least less noticeable—because if you’ve gone to the effort (and expense!) of transforming your look, why settle for reminders that you had surgery at all? 🤔
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s where scar camouflaging comes in—an innovative, artistic, and highly effective treatment designed to blend scars seamlessly with your natural skin tone. Think of it as finishing what you started. You didn’t just invest in surgery to improve your appearance; you invested in feeling amazing inside and out. So why stop at the surgery?
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagine this: you’ve undergone a tummy tuck to reclaim your silhouette and confidence. The procedure has worked wonders, but the scar is still there, telling its story. With scar camouflaging, we can dramatically reduce the visibility of that scar by tattooing pigments that match your skin tone, creating a smooth, natural finish. It’s like makeup that never washes off—but better, because it’s designed specifically for your unique skin and scar. 💫👌
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s not about erasing your journey—it’s about empowering you to control the narrative. Your body, your story, your confidence. And if you’ve committed to this journey, why not go all the way? Complete the transformation with scar camouflaging and step out feeling flawless, inside and out.

                    You've just had your anti-wrinkle injections—exciting! Whether it’s your first time or you’re a regular, what you do in the hours and days after treatment is just as important as the injections themselves. Following the right aftercare helps ensure you get optimal results and avoid unwanted side effects.

                <p>
                    Here’s your ultimate list of what to do—and what to avoid—after anti-wrinkle injections.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">✅ DO:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔️ <strong>Stay Upright for 4 Hours:</strong> Gravity matters. Staying upright prevents the product from migrating to unintended areas, especially around delicate zones like the eyes or brows.</li>
                    <li>✔️ <strong>Gently Exercise Your Face:</strong> Frown, raise your brows, smile—just a little facial movement can help the product settle into the right muscles more effectively.</li>
                    <li>✔️ <strong>Keep Your Face Clean:</strong> You can gently cleanse your face the same day with mild products, just avoid excessive rubbing or tugging.</li>
                    <li>✔️ <strong>Be Patient:</strong> It takes 3–5 days to start seeing results, and full effects usually appear around 10–14 days post-treatment. Don’t worry if you don’t see changes right away.</li>
                    <li>✔️ <strong>Book a Follow-Up (if needed):</strong> A review appointment around 2 weeks after treatment may be offered to assess results and tweak if necessary. Some minor adjustments are common and part of a personalised approach.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">❌ DON’T:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>✖️ <strong>Don’t Touch or Rub the Treated Area:</strong> Avoid massaging, pressing, or leaning on the area for at least 24 hours. This includes facials, heavy makeup application, or sleeping face-down.</li>
                    <li>✖️ <strong>Don’t Exercise for 24 Hours:</strong> Sweating, increased blood flow, or vigorous movement too soon can shift the product or lead to bruising.</li>
                    <li>✖️ <strong>Don’t Drink Alcohol:</strong> Skip alcohol for 24 hours after your appointment—it can thin the blood and increase the risk of bruising or swelling.</li>
                    <li>✖️ <strong>Don’t Use Saunas, Steam Rooms, or Hot Showers:</strong> Heat can increase inflammation and may interfere with how the product settles. Give it a full 24–48 hours before indulging in heat-based treatments.</li>
                    <li>✖️ <strong>Don’t Panic About Minor Bruising:</strong> Tiny bruises or swelling are completely normal and usually fade within a few days. Arnica gel (applied gently) can help speed up healing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">🧴 Can I Wear Makeup?</h3>
                <p>
                    Light makeup can be applied after a minimum of 12 hours to reduce the risk of infection or irritation. Use clean brushes and avoid pressing hard on the skin.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">🤔 What If Something Feels Off?</h3>
                <p>
                    While serious side effects are extremely rare, always reach out if you notice:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unusual pain, swelling, or redness</li>
                    <li>Eyelid drooping</li>
                    <li>Headache that won’t go away</li>
                    <li>Anything that feels “off” to you</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When in doubt—message or call. You're never overreacting when it comes to your face.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">💬 Final Word: Aftercare = Better Results</h3>
                <p>
                    Anti-wrinkle injections are quick and effective—but they’re not a "set-it-and-forget-it" treatment. By following these simple dos and don’ts, you’re giving the product the best chance to settle beautifully and naturally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it’s your first time or part of your regular beauty routine, your results (and your confidence) are worth protecting.

                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how do you know which one is right for your skin? Let’s break it down.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">First, What Is Microneedling?</h2>
                <p>
                    Microneedling (also known as collagen induction therapy) uses a device with ultra-fine needles to create tiny micro-injuries in the skin. This triggers your body’s natural healing process, stimulating collagen and elastin production. Over time, skin becomes firmer, smoother, and more even in tone and texture.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">✅ Great for:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fine lines and wrinkles</li>
                    <li>Acne scars or surgical scars</li>
                    <li>Enlarged pores</li>
                    <li>Stretch marks</li>
                    <li>Uneven skin tone</li>
                    <li>Skin texture concerns</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Think of microneedling as your skin’s wake-up call. It encourages your skin to regenerate from within—naturally.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">💧 What Are Skin Boosters?</h2>
                <p>
                    Skin boosters are injectable treatments designed to improve skin quality, hydration, and elasticity. They contain a blend of active ingredients, often including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hyaluronic acid – for deep hydration</li>
                    <li>Amino acids – to support skin cell metabolism and collagen synthesis</li>
                    <li>Polynucleotides – DNA fragments that help repair and regenerate damaged skin tissue</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional fillers, skin boosters don’t add volume. Instead, they work on improving the skin itself—making it plumper, more radiant, and more youthful from the inside out.
                </p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">✅ Great for:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dull, tired-looking skin</li>
                    <li>Dehydration or crepey texture</li>
                    <li>Fine lines (especially under the eyes)</li>
                    <li>Loss of elasticity</li>
                    <li>Smoothing and brightening the overall appearance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Skin boosters act like a supercharged internal moisturizer, plus they support long-term skin repair and cellular renewal—especially when polynucleotides and amino acids are included.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">Can You Combine Them?</h2>
                <p>
                    Absolutely—microneedling and skin boosters work beautifully together, especially for clients wanting both collagen stimulation and hydration/repair. A combined approach can tackle:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ageing skin that needs firmness and moisture</li>
                    <li>Skin with post-acne texture + dehydration</li>
                    <li>Brides and event prep clients looking for a flawless finish</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We often stagger treatments or customise your plan for optimal results.
                </p>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">🚫 Who Shouldn’t Have These?</h2>
                <p>These treatments are not recommended if you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have active acne, rosacea flares, or inflamed skin</li>
                    <li>Are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
                    <li>Have certain autoimmune or bleeding disorders</li>
                    <li>Are currently using blood-thinning medications (consultation is required)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 className="font-semibold text-xl mb-4">💬 So, Which One Does Your Skin Need?</h2>
                <p>
                    Choose microneedling if you want to tackle texture, scarring, or are looking to firm and regenerate skin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose skin boosters if your skin feels dehydrated, tired, or in need of a quick, long-lasting glow.
                </p>
                <p>
